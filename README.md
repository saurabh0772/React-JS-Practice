# React-JS-Practice
Learning react js from scratch to intermediate level and hands on some important git commands.



Notes
    1. Add cdn links for react and reactdom
    2. react is used to create elements : var h1 = React.createElement('tagname', property(null), "content in tag")
    3. reactdom is use to connect those element and show in frontend
    4. a root element is use : var root = ReactDOM.createRoot('tagname')
    5. to show, we use render : root.render(tagname)
